endian

This module creates the appropriate typedef for the endian
header file.

It does a simple pointer check to see if memory is in little
endian or big endian format. There are no plans to support
middle endian byte ordering. The module writes a header file
on standard out.

It writes an 'endian:' line in sysdeps.out.
