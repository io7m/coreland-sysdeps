io-notice

This module defines some constants to show what IO notification
mechanisms are available on the current platform.

select() is defined in different headers on different systems. There is
a seperate sysdeps module for getting the right #include directives.  To
keep things simple, this module does its own checks based on work done
in that module, rather than try to complicate the sysdeps system and
execute the 'select' module directly.

It writes an 'io-notice:' line in sysdeps.out listing all available
mechanisms.
