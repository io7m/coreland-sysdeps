sd-byteorder

This module creates the appropriate typedef for the byteorder
header file.

It does a simple pointer check to see if memory is in little
endian or big endian format. There are no plans to support
middle endian byte ordering. The module writes a header file.

An 'sd-byteorder:' line is written in sysdeps.out.
