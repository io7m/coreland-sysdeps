aio-mech

This module defines some constants to show what asynchronous
IO mechanisms are available on the current platform.

select() is defined in different headers on different systems. There
is a seperate sysdeps module for getting the right #include directives.
To keep things simple, this module does it's own checks based up work
done in that module, rather than try to complicate the sysdeps system
and execute the 'select' module directly.

It writes an 'aio-mech:' line in sysdeps.out listing all available
mechanisms.
