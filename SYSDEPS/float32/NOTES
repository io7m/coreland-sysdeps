float32

This module creates the appropriate typedef for the float32
header file.

It does some checks with sizeof() to see which C float
declarations are 32 bits in size on this platform.

This module is terminal: if the system doesn't have 32 bit
floating point numbers, the build is halted.

It writes a 'float32:' line in sysdeps.out.
