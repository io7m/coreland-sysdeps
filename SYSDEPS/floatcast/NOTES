floatcast

This module creates the floatcast header file.

Casting a floating point value to an integer is very slow due to
the FPU having to use the 'fldcw' instruction (or equivalent for
other architectures) to meet the C standard. The lrint() family
of functions cause the FPU to use rounding instead of truncation
and avoid the 'fldcw' instruction. This results in significantly
faster code.

The header files defined macros for 'floatcast', 'doublecast',
'llfloatcast' and 'lldoublecast' which correspond to either a
C cast or one of the relevant 'lrint' functions.

It writes a 'floatcast:' line in sysdeps.out.
