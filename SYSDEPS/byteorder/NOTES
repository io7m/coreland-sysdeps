endian

This module creates the appropriate typedef for the endian
header file.

It does a simple pointer check to see if memory is in little
endian or big endian format. There are no plans to support
middle endian byte ordering. The module writes a header file.

This module is terminal, if the system isn't running in little
endian or big endian mode, the build is halted.

An 'endian:' line is written in sysdeps.out.
