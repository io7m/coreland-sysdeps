floats

This module creates the appropriate typedef for the floats
header files.

It does some checks with sizeof() to see which C float
declarations are 32 and 64 bits in size on this platform.

It creates various header files.

This module is terminal: if the system doesn't have 32 bit
or 64 bit floating point numbers, the build is halted.

It writes a 'float32:' and 'float64:' line in sysdeps.out.
