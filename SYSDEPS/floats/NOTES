floats

This module creates the appropriate typedef for the floats
header files.

It does some checks with sizeof() to see which C float
declarations are 32 and 64 bits in size on this platform.
The modules writes a header file on standard out.

It writes a 'float32:' and 'float64:' line in sysdeps.out.
