Some platforms most likely just can't support parallel builds due to
a lack of file locking.

Perhaps:

  $ (cd SYSDEPS && ./sd-parallel)
  Supported
  $ (cd SYSDEPS && ./sd-parallel)
  Unsupported

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unify posix and win32 sd-locker.

Check architecture before compiling sd-cpuidx86 so that "unexpected failure"
can be detected.
