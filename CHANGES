20060426 version: sysdeps-0.1
20060426 code: base sysdeps in place (enough for corelib)
20060426 code: sdl sysdeps added
20060426 code: png sysdeps added
20060426 code: ch_flags added with source
20060426 code: ch_flags unit tests added
20060429 note: moved to svn
20060501 code: do not generate sysdeps for .svn directories!
20060502 code: renamed makefile-local to Mkfile-local and restructured
               slightly due to cpj-genmk updates.
20060502 code: further restructuring for cpj-genmk.
20060507 code: updated to cpj-genmk-0.6
20060507 code: fixed x86cpuid so failure no longer means death.
20060507 version: sysdeps-0.11
20060510 code: added DESCRIPTION files for inspection by coreproject
               cpj-sysdeps tools.
20060513 code: seperated SDL into SDL_image, SDL_mixer, SDL and OpenGL.
               SDL_mixer and OpenGL are currently non-functioning place
               holders and none of it has been tested on Darwin.
20060516 code: tested png-flags/libs on sunos and adjusted for
               portability.
20060516 code: updated to cpj-genmk-0.7
20060516 code: ch_flags #define statements have had their names changed
               FLAGS_WORKING -> CH_FLAGS_WORKING
               HAS_CHFLAGS -> CH_FLAGS_HAVE_CHFLAGS
               HAS_EXT2FS_IOCTL -> CH_FLAGS_HAVE_EXT2FS_IOCTL
               policyengine will need updating in the future to take
               care of these changes.
20060516 code: major refactor of SYSDEPS. now all libs and flags style
               sysdeps source 'sysdep-subs' for generic search
               functions. coreproject will need to be updated to reflect
               the changes.
