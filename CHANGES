20060426 version: sysdeps-0.1
20060426 code: base sysdeps in place (enough for corelib)
20060426 code: sdl sysdeps added
20060426 code: png sysdeps added
20060426 code: ch_flags added with source
20060426 code: ch_flags unit tests added
20060429 note: moved to svn
20060501 code: do not generate sysdeps for .svn directories!
20060502 code: renamed makefile-local to Mkfile-local and restructured
               slightly due to cpj-genmk updates.
20060502 code: further restructuring for cpj-genmk.
20060507 code: updated to cpj-genmk-0.6
20060507 code: fixed x86cpuid so failure no longer means death.
20060507 version: sysdeps-0.11
20060510 code: added DESCRIPTION files for inspection by coreproject
               cpj-sysdeps tools.
20060513 code: seperated SDL into SDL_image, SDL_mixer, SDL and OpenGL.
               SDL_mixer and OpenGL are currently non-functioning place
               holders and none of it has been tested on Darwin.
20060516 code: tested png-flags/libs on sunos and adjusted for
               portability.
20060516 code: updated to cpj-genmk-0.7
20060516 code: ch_flags #define statements have had their names changed
               FLAGS_WORKING -> CH_FLAGS_WORKING
               HAS_CHFLAGS -> CH_FLAGS_HAVE_CHFLAGS
               HAS_EXT2FS_IOCTL -> CH_FLAGS_HAVE_EXT2FS_IOCTL
               policyengine will need updating in the future to take
               care of these changes.
20060516 code: major refactor of SYSDEPS. now all libs and flags style
               sysdeps source 'sysdep-subs' for generic search
               functions. coreproject will need to be updated to reflect
               the changes.
20060516 code: to help predictability and uniformity of filenames
               produced by SYSDEPS, current hyphenated names have been
               reversed: sdl-flags becomes flags-sdl, png-libs becomes
               libs-png. This will prevent possible filename collisions.
20060521 code: added SDL_ttf
20060523 code: added dlopen
20060523 code: changed direntry to use temporary files, for better
               behaviour on hard error (no trampling on sysdeps.out)
20060524 code: added signal
20060603 code: sysdeps are now quiet by default.
20060603 code: if a sysdep does not create a header file, it defines
               a preprocessor #define in order to show whether it ran
               successfully or not. png-flags, for example, defines
               HAVE_LIBPNG. this should aid conditional and optional
               compilation.
20060603 version: sysdeps-0.20
20060620 code: restructure to run scripts instead of makefile.
               terminal and non-terminal modules.
               depchklist for the curious.
20060621 code: more general scheme. check sysdep-subs for new vars.
20060621 code: dlopen fix on linux
20060621 code: remove ext2fs code from ch_flags.
20060622 code: added jack
20060702 code: added corelib
20060705 code: all generated headers now exist before compilation and
               include an underscore prefixed version of themselves.
               this is intended to make the code more understandable as
               there will no longer be any code importing header files
               that don't exist before compilation.
20060706 code: hpux -> hp-ux in sysdep-subs.
20060718 code: stupid FreeBSD port workarounds for SDL.
20060719 code: FLTK added.
20060720 code: moved FLTK to FLTK11 as there are two incompatible
               versions in use.
